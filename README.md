**Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)**
**Conceptual Understanding:**
 
**Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?**
- YES
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
- YES
 
 
**Web API: (Yes/No) 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?**
- NO
 
 

**Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:**
 
 
**Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)**
1. Separation of concerns
2. Testability
3. Maintainability
 
**Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)**
- Yes a lot actually, fisrt i have no idea what i am doing so i hav eto research a lot and there is not a lot of video tutorial on how to apply it. Not only in onion architecture i have to learn a completely different language while learning 2 different languages at the same time.
 
 

**MVC:
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.**
  **Model:** Data representation, Business logic
  **View:** User interface presentation
  **Controller:** Handling user input, Orchestrating interactions

 
 
 
**Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)**
- Previously YES but now it level up so yeah. 
 
 

**Web API:
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.**
- NO, still stuck at learning
 

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
- NO, still stuck at learning
